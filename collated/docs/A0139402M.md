**Product #3: to-doist**<br>
Strengths:

1. Supports adding of tasks that can be marked as 'done' → Jim is able to mark completed tasks as done
2. Supports searching of tasks by its name and project → Jim is able to quickly find a task
3. Adding of tasks is done in a one-shot manner → Jim is able to avoid taking several clicks to add a task
4. Operates offline and only starts syncing with other devices when there is Internet connection → Jim can access the application even without internet connectivity.
5. Supports a desktop version → Jim is able to access the application quickly.
6. Supports adding of tasks with no specific time tagged to it → Jim is able to add tasks that do not require a specific time to be completed.
7. Allows easy and straightforward postponement of tasks → Jim can easily postpone tasks should the need arise


Weakness:

1. Does not allow for block scheduling of tasks (e.g. can only schedule tasks at 3pm and not 3 - 5pm) → Jim cannot schedule tasks in block timings
2. Does not provide a user-friendly way to look for a suitable slot to schedule an item → Jim has to go through all existing tasks to look for an empty slot to schedule a new task
3. Unable to block multiple slots for tasks with unconfirmed timings → Jim will find it hard to schedule tasks with unconfirmed timings
4. Syncing of data with the cloud occurs only when there is Internet connectivity → Jim will have to require Internet connectivity if he wants to use the application with all his existing tasks on another computer
