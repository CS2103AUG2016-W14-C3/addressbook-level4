### Model component

<img align="center" src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png">
<div align="center">Figure 9: Model Class Diagram</div><br>

**API**: [`Model.java`](../src/main/taskle/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores Taskle's data.
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed'.
	* Example: The UI can be bound to this list so that it automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.
* Stores the current instance of Taskle should the user input a mutating command, such as `add`.

## Appendix E : Product Survey

The team has conducted a survey on existing products and analysed the strengths and weaknesses with respect to how well it can cater to our target audience.

**Product #1: Wunderlist**<br>
Strengths:

1. Supports adding of floating tasks and deadlines. User’s one-shot approach is met when adding floating tasks.
2. Supports editing and deleting of existing tasks. User is able to not only reschedule, but also discard tasks that cannot be completed.
3. Supports adding of deadlines and reminders. User will be reminded when a deadline is approaching.
4. Supports searching and sorting of to-do items. User is able to find specific tasks easily.
5. Supports viewing of tasks that are completed. User is able to know which tasks are completed and which are yet to be completed. 
6. Supports offline work. User does not have to depend on Internet connectivity to use application.
7. Displays tasks in a user-friendly manner.

Weaknesses:

1. Does not work with time slots. User is not able to manage events.
2. Does not categorise tasks. User may find it hard to differentiate floating tasks from deadlines.
3. Does not support an "Undo" option. Tasks that were incorrectly added has to be edited or deleted manually.
4. Does not store data into local storage files but links to an online user account instead. Internet connectivity is still dependent if user wants to work from different computers.
5. Requires a few clicks to perform functions other than adding a floating task. User’s one-shot approach is not met.

### Edit a Task: `rename; reschedule; remind`
Edits an existing task in Taskle. There are three types of possible edits: Rename, Reschedule and Remind. You are required to input the **task_number** (as indicated in the ID column of Figure 3) in order for Taskle to identify the task that you wish to edit.<br><br>

|Type      | Format  |
|:-------- |:--------|
|Rename    | `rename` **`task_number`** **`new_task_name`** |
|Reschedule| `reschedule` **`task_number`** `date` [**`time`**] [**`to` `date time`**] |
|Remind    | `remind` **`task_number`** `date` [**`time`**] |

> **Things to Note**
> * A  task can only have **one reminder**. The date and time that were specified in the "remind" command will replace any existing reminder.
> * If **no time** was specified for the reminder, Taskle will automatically assign 00:00 of the specified reminder date to it.
> * To remove a reminder or deadline / event date from a task, you will have to type **"clear"** after typing the task number. For example:
>  * remind 2 **clear**
>  * reschedule 2 **clear**

Examples:
* `rename` **`8 Pay Abel for Chicken Rice`**
