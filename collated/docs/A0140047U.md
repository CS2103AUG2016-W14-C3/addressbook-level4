### Model component

<div align="center">Figure 8: Model Class Diagram</div><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/taskle/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Task Manager data.
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

**Product #1: Wunderlist**<br>
Strengths:

1. Supports adding of floating tasks and deadlines → One-shot approach for Jim (floating tasks)
2. Supports editing and deleting of existing tasks → Jim is able to reschedule and discard to-do items that cannot be completed
3. Supports adding of deadlines and reminders → Reminder available for Jim whenever a deadline is approaching
4. Supports searching and sorting of to-do items → Ease of finding specific to-do items
5. Displays to-do items in a user-friendly manner
6. Able to work offline → Jim does not have to depend on Internet access
7. Able to view tasks that are completed → Jim is able to know what tasks are completed and yet to be completed

Weakness:

1. Does not work with time slots → Jim is not able to add events
2. Does not categorise to-do types (Events, Deadlines, Floating Tasks)
3. Requires a few clicks to perform functions other than adding a task → Jim's one-shot approach is not fulfilled
4. Does not support an "Undo" option → Incorrect to-do item created has to be edited/deleted instead
5. Does not store data into local storage files. Links with user account (online) instead → Online access still required to transfer data if Jim works with different computers

### Edit a Task : `edit; reschedule; remind`
Edits an existing task in Taskle. There are 3 types of edits possible: Edit task name, Reschedule and Remind. You are required to input the **task_number** (as indicated in Figure 3) in order for Taskle to identify which task you wish to edit.<br><br>

Type | Format  
:-------- | :-------- 
Edit task name | `edit `**`task_number new_task_name`**  
Reschedule | `reschedule `**`task_number date`**`[`**`time`**`] to ` **`date`**`[`**`time`**`] [remind `**`date time`**`]`
Remind | `remind `**`task_number date`**`[`**` time`**`]`

> **Things to Note**
> * A  task can only have one reminder. The date and time as specified in the "remind" command would replace any existing reminder.
> * If **Time** is not specified for reminders, Taskle will automatically assign the reminder time as 00:00 for the specified reminder date.
> * To remove a reminder or deadline from a task, you will have to type **"clear"** after typing the task number. For example:
>	* remind **2 clear**
>	* reschedule **2 clear**


Examples:
* `edit `**`6 Pay Abel for Chicken Rice`**
<br>

### Listing tasks: `list`
Lists tasks according to specified statuses. Use this command to view your tasks
according to whether they are done, overdue or pending. <br>

| Format

> **Things to Note**
> * The following statues are available:
>	* **-all**: All tasks in Taskle
>	* **-pending**: Tasks that are still pending.
>	* **-done**: Tasks that are marked as done.
>	* **-overdue**: Tasks that are overdue (applicable for deadlines only.)
> * It is optional to specify the status. If no status is specified, the default
tasks to be displayed are the pending and overdue ones. (Done tasks are not shown).
> * You may specify more than one status. In that case all tasks that fulfill any of the flags would be displayed. For example:
>	* list **-pending** **-overdue**

Example:
* `list` **`-all`**
