## Introduction
Taskle is a task management application that helps users to keep track of their tasks efficiently.  It comprises a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the input and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the output of commands respectively.

This guide describes the design and implementation of Taskle. It will help you understand how Taskle works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.

### UI component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](../src/main/taskle/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts `CommandBox`, `CommandResult`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `StatusDisplayPanel` and `TaskCard`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, and can be loaded through `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/taskle/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands through the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the application before updating the UI accordingly.
