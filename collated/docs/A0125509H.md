## Introduction
Taskle is a task management application that helps users keep track of their tasks efficiently.  It comprises a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the input of all commands and a GUI for the output.  

This guide describes the design and implementation of Taskle. It will help you understand how Taskle works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.

### UI component

<img align="center" src="images/UiClassDiagram.png">
<div align="center">Figure 5: User Interface Class Diagram</div><br>


**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/taskle/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` and `TaskCard`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/taskle/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

## Appendix E : Product Survey

The team has done a survey on existing products and analysed the strengths and weaknesses with respect to how well it can cater to our target audience.<br><br>

**Product #4: SolCalendar**<br>
Strengths:

1. Supports marking tasks as complete
2. Supports searching of appointments and tasks by name → Jim is able to quickly search for items in his schedule
3. Operates even without Internet Access  Jim can access the application even without Internet connectivity
4. Supports adding of tasks (without any due date)
5. Allows easy and straightforward postponement of tasks → Jim can easily postpone tasks should the need arise
6. Supports time-based reminders → Jim can schedule reminders for his deadlines
7. Displays to-do items in a user-friendly manner → Jim can periodically review his to-do list
8. Supports the editing and deleting of existing tasks → Jim is able to reschedule and remove any tasks
9. Supports setting of to-do items on repeat (for routine purposes)


Weakness:

1. Requires two clicks to add a task with its respective settings → Does not cater to Jim's one-shot preference
2. Does not support an "Undo" option → A task has to be manually deleted upon creation
3. Does not support blocking out specific time slots (without full information)
