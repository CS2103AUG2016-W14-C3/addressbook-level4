## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img align="center" src="images/Architecture.png">
<div align="center">Figure 1: Architecture Diagram</div><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/taskle/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br><br>

<img align="center" src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" >
<div align="center">Figure 2: Logic Class Diagram Example</div><br><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `remove 1`.<br>

<img align="center" src="images/SDforDeletePerson.png">
<div align="center">Figure 3: Sequence Diagram for Delete Person</div><br>

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the Task Manager data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

<br>
The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br><br>
<img align="center" src="images/SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png">
<div align="center">Figure 4: Sequence Diagram for Handling of Events</div><br>

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

<br>
The sections below give more details of each component.

### Logic component

<img align="center" src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png">
<div align="center">Figure 6: Logic Class Diagram</div><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/taskle/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. `History` saves the commands that `LogicManager` executes.
3. `Parser` uses the CommandParser classes to parse the command.
4. It returns a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
5. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("remove 1")` API call.<br><br>

**Product #2: Google Keep**<br>
Strengths:

1. Supports adding of checklist items → Jim is able to mark as done
2. Supports time-based reminders → Jim is able to schedule reminders for his tasks deadlines
3. Supports searching of to-do items by description and types → Jim is able to find a to-do item quickly
4. Displays to-do items are listed in a user-friendly manner → Jim is able to periodically review his to-do items
5. Operates even without Internet access → Jim is able to access the application even without Internet connectivity

Weakness:

1. Requires a few clicks to add a tasks followed by setting reminders → Jim's one-shot preference is not met
2. Only supports reminders, does not allow Jim to block out slots for items without specific times.
3. Does not support calendar-centric operations → Jim is not able to schedule tasks with specific start and end dates.

## Features

Taskle makes it elegantly simple to manage your tasks. All of its features require only a single line of command, making it a hassle-free experience to keep track of your tasks!

> **Note that the following conventions are used for all command formats:**
> * **`BOLDED`** words are parameters.
> * Items in `[SQUARE_BRACKETS]` are optional.
> * The order of parameters is fixed.

<br>

### Add a Task / Event: `add`
   * Adds a task / event into Taskle (with its respective deadline or end-date.)
   * A reminder time can be set for tasks / events.
   * The time parameter is optional.

| Format  
| :-------- 
| `add `**`task_name`**` [remind `**`date time`**`]` | 
| `add `**`deadline_name`**` by `**`date`**` [`**`time`**`] [remind `**`date time`**`]` |
| `add `**`event_name`**` from `**`date`**`[`**`time`**`] to `**`date`**` [`**`time`**`] [remind `**`date time`**`]`

> **`Note`**
> * You may enter the data and time in any format that you desire, and Taskle will still be able to recognise it.
> * Only the words after the last **by** or **from** in your input will be taken as the date and time. This allows you to continue using **by** and **from** as part of your task name as long as you enter the date and times last. For example:
> 	* "add **Gardens by the Bay** from **9am to 9pm today**" adds a task with the name "Gardens by the Bay" with the date and time to be set to "9am to 9pm today".


Examples:
* `add `**`Pay Phone Bills`**
* `add `**`Do CS2101 Assignment`**` by `**`12 Oct`**
* `add `**`Business Trip`**` from `**`4 Oct`**` to `**`5 Oct`**` remind `**`3 Oct 2pm`**
